I'm Tolu, a highly motivated AI and Data Science professional with a passion for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems. 


I consider myself a problem solver - from understanding business problems, data gathering, data analysis, and building predictive systems; to communicating informed insights. Having worked on projects across industries like aviation, government, retail, and healthcare, my skills and experience involve solving challenging problems using data-driven solutions. Outside of work, I enjoy music, sports, try new things; this helps me keep an open and creative mindset. Feel free to connect with me.
